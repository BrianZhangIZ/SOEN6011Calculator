# Standard Deviation Calculator (σ)

A Java application that calculates the **standard deviation (σ)** of a dataset, implemented as part of the SOEN 6011 course project.  
The application includes both a **Java Swing GUI** and a **math logic class** for computational accuracy, with unit tests written in **JUnit 5**.

## Features
- **Accurate statistical computation** of population standard deviation.
- **Java Swing GUI** for interactive use.
- **Error handling** for invalid or empty inputs.
- **Unit testing** with JUnit 5.
- **Static code analysis** using PMD and Google Checkstyle.
- **Semantic versioning** for release tracking.
